# Project Title

CREATE MY OWN TOKEN

## Description

My contract will have public variables that store the details about your coin (Token Name, Token Abbrv., Total Supply)
My contract will have a mapping of addresses to balances (address => uint)
It will have a mint function that takes two parameters: an address and a value. The function then increases the total supply by that number and increases the balance of the address by that amount.
My contract will have a burn function, which works the opposite of the mint function, as it will destroy tokens. It will take an address and value just like the mint functions. It will then deduct the value from the total supply and from the balance of the address.
Lastly,  burn function should have conditionals to make sure the balance of account is greater than or equal to the amount that is supposed to be burned.

### Executing program
after writing the whole code with given requirements
Introduction to Data Types
Mapping in Solidity
Functions Demonstration
(Same as #3.)
Conditional Statements
we will now compile the program and the deploy it on the local blockchain
now we will call the functions
